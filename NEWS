flycircuit 0.5.2
================
* fix subtle bug in plot3dfc revealed only when this is used inside a function.
* plot3dfc can now accept a character vector for the db argument.

flycircuit 0.5.1
================
* fix hclustfc (was not attaching scoremat)
* refactor fc_subscoremat (using nat.nblast::sub_score_mat)
* dev: remove internal diagonal function and tests

flycircuit 0.5
==============
* deprecated pop3dfc in favour of nat::npop3d
* refactored plot3dfc to use nat::plot3d.character. plot3dfc will be deprecated
  in favour of plot3d.character when that function can coped with multiple
  identifier styles.

flycircuit 0.4.1
================
* extensive refactoring so that fc_nblast, hclustfc and friends are now thin
  wrappers on more generic functions in nat.nblast
* plot3dfc can handle NA soma positions
* update annotation table
* docs: plot3dfc improvements
* add fcgn_forfile

flycircuit 0.3.1
================
* significant (20x in my tests) speedup for hclustfc using large ff objects
  containing raw scores.

flycircuit 0.3
==============
* ready for use by external code
* add subset.hclust, plot3d.hclust
* make sure that clustering based on pre-computed nblast scores all works 
  properly and that ff cached versions of the data are available
* only provide ff cached versions of raw scores for download and normalise on
  the fly
* fix errors in package vignette
