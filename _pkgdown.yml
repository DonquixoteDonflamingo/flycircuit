    desc: >
      There are at least 3 different kinds of identifiers in use with the 
      flycircuit database. These functions convert between them as well as making
      additional metadata available. Furthermore annotations carried out in the
      course of the Costa et al. NBLAST study are also available - these include
      the identification of 5400 neuronal types as well as the glomeruli 
      innervated by 433 olfactory projection neurons.

  - title: Support for remote / optional data
    desc: >
      Some flycircuit functionality depends on data which is not bundled
      into the R package (since it is about 4GB in size). These functions handle
      download and access to such data.
